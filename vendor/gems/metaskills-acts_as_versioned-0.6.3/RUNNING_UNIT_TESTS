== Creating the test database

The default name for the test databases is can be found in the test/lib/database.yml files. By 
default the tests will run on sqlite3 but can be changed using and ENV['DB'] variable like postresql,
mysql or even sqlserver.

== Running with Rake

The easiest way to run the unit tests is through Rake. The default task runs all the test cases. 
There is even a rake task called test_dbs that will run all test cases for each DB.

== Running by hand

Unit tests are located in test directory. If you only want to run a single test suite, 
or don't want to bother with Rake, you can do so with something like:

   cd test ; ruby -I "test" versioned_test.rb
   
Likewise you can just hit Command-R if you are using TextMate.
